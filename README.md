A repo to contain my work for ECE597 (Embedded 32-Bit Linux) at Rose-Hulman

## Etch-a-Sketch
The goal of this project is to create a console-based etch-a-sketch. This code will transition into a physical etch-a-sketch on a LED matrix.

Run with ./etch.js

## Homework 2
This is the same etch-a-sketch code, but written in JS. Additionally, it utilizes buttons to move the cursor around.

Run with ./etch.js

## Homework 3
This is a re-written version of homework 2. There is no longer any screen refresh, the output display only redraws individual pixels after button presses. Additionally, the output display is now an 8x8 bi-color LED matrix.

Run with ./etch.js
