A repo to contain my work for ECE597 (Embedded 32-Bit Linux) at Rose-Hulman

## Etch-a-Sketch
The goal of this project is to create a console-based etch-a-sketch. This code will transition into a physical etch-a-sketch on a LED matrix.

## Etch-a-Sketch-V2
This is the same etch-a-sketch code, but written in JS. Additionally, it utilizes buttons to move the cursor around.
